To properly analyze a circuit using Modified Nodal Analysis, it is crucial to accurately construct the necessary matrices. This involves setting up a linear algebra problem Ax=z with the following definitions for A, x, and z below in single quotes.

For a circuit with n nodes and m independent voltage sources:
- The A matrix is (n+m)x(n+m) in size and consists of known quantities. It is organized as A = [[G, B], [C, D]], where G, B, C, and D are submatrices with the following definitions:
  - The G matrix is the nxn part of the matrix in the upper left. Each element on the diagonal is equal to the sum of the conductance (one over the resistance) of each element connected to the corresponding node. The off-diagonal elements are the negative conductance of the element connected to the pair of corresponding nodes.
  - The B matrix is an n×m matrix with only 0, 1, and -1 elements. Each location in the matrix corresponds to a particular voltage source (first dimension) or a node (second dimension). If the positive terminal of the ith voltage source is connected to node k, then the element (i,k) in the B matrix is 1. If the negative terminal of the ith voltage source is connected to node k, then the element (i,k) in the B matrix is -1. Otherwise, elements of the B matrix are zero.
  - The C matrix is an m×n matrix equal to the transpose of the B matrix.
  - The D matrix is an m×m matrix that is composed entirely of zeros.
- The x matrix is (m+n)×1 in size and holds our unknown quantities. It is organized as x = [[v], [j]], where v and j are submatrices with the following definitions:
  - The v matrix is an n×1 matrix formed of the node voltages. Each element in v corresponds to the voltage at the equivalent node in the circuit (there is no entry for ground -- node 0).
  - The j matrix is an m×1 matrix with one entry for the current through each voltage source.
- The z matrix is an (n+m)x1 vector that holds only known quantities and is organized as z = [[i], [e]], where i and e are submatrices with the following definitions:
  - The i matrix is an n×1 matrix with each element corresponding to a particular node. The value of each element of i is determined by the sum of current sources into the corresponding node. If there are no current sources connected to the node, the value is zero.
  - The e matrix is an m×1 matrix with each element equal in value to the corresponding independent voltage source.

To ensure accurate analysis of the circuit, it is important to double-check component values and units before proceeding with calculations. Thoroughly analyze the circuit to correctly identify the number of nodes and independent voltage sources, ensuring that the sizing of matrices corresponds to these quantities. Verify the accuracy of matrix configuration against the circuit's topology before finalizing the system of equations.
