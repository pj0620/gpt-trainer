# Building the Matrix using Modified Nodal Analysis

To solve using Modified Nodal Analysis, we will need to build the following linear algebra problem.

A x = z

where A, x, and z are defined as below

The A matrix:
is (n+m)x(n+m) in size, and consists only of known quantities.
the nxn part of the matrix in the upper left:
has only passive elements
elements connected to ground appear only on the diagonal
elements not connected to ground are both on the diagonal and off-diagonal terms.
the rest of the A matrix (not included in the nxn upper left part) contains only 1, -1 and 0 (other values are possible if there are dependent current and voltage sources; I have not considered these cases.  Consult Litovski if interested.)
The x matrix:
is an (n+m)x1 vector that holds the unknown quantities (node voltages and the currents through the independent voltage sources).
the top n elements are the n node voltages.
the bottom m elements represent the currents through the m independent voltage sources in the circuit.
The z matrix:
is an (n+m)x1 vector that holds only known quantities
the top n elements are either zero or the sum and difference of independent current sources in the circuit.
the bottom m elements represent the m independent voltage sources in the circuit.
