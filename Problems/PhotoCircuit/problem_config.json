    "- The A matrix is (n+m) x (n+m) in size and consists of submatrices G, B, C, and D.",
    "- The G matrix is nxn and represents the conductances connected to each node. Each diagonal element should be the sum of conductances connected to the corresponding node, and off-diagonal elements should correspond to negative conductances between nodes. Double-check the accuracy of the conductance values to avoid errors in the G matrix. Carefully recheck the circuit to ensure the sum of the conductances is correctly calculated for each node and use a systematic approach for calculating the elements of the G matrix to prevent calculation errors.",
    "- The B matrix is an n×m matrix that indicates the connections between voltage sources and nodes. Elements should be 1 if the positive terminal of the ith voltage source is connected to node k, -1 if the negative terminal is connected to node k, and 0 otherwise. Take care to accurately represent the connections and polarity of voltage sources when filling out the B matrix. Ensure that the B matrix is transposed correctly to avoid incorrect representation in the final linear algebra problem.",
