The following is a list of properties of the circuit

# Building the Matrix using KVL

I will use KVL analysis instead of the other option KCL. Note that the current in the kth loop will be set to Ik, so the loop current of Loop 1 is I1.

Loop 1: 8 * I1 + -j2 * I1 + j4 * (I1 - I2) = 0
Loop 2: j4 * (I2 - I1) + 6 * (I2 - 10∠0°) + 50∠30° = 0
Loop 3: Part of Supermesh, no equation

we can rearrange these equations to better convert to a linear algebra problem. I will not be simplifying or combining any phasor values.

(8 + j2) * I1 + (-j4) * I2 = 0
(  - j4) * I1 + ( 6 + j4) * I2 = 6 * 10∠0° - 50∠30°

These can be combined into final linear algebra problem. Note that the angle symbol(∠) is replaced with the latex equivalent(\angle) and the degree symbol(°) is replaced with latex equivalent(^\circ)

\begin{bmatrix}
8 + j2 & - j4 \\
  - j4 & 6 + j4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
I_1 \\
I_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
6 * 10\angle0^\circ - 50\angle30^\circ
\end{bmatrix}

# Building the Matrix

I will use KVL analysis instead of the other option KCL. Note that the voltsge in the kth node will be set to Vk, so the voltage of Node 1 is V1.

Since there is no ground node, I am going to choose Node 1 to be ground. Thus V1 = 0V.

Also, since Node 4 is connected Node 1, they can be combined into a supernode, and thus a new equation V4 = V0 + 50∠30° = 50∠30° V

Node 1 & 4 Supernode: (V2 - 0) / 8 + (V3 - 0) / j4 + (V3 - 50∠30°) / 6 - 10∠0° = 0
Node 2: - (V2 - 0) / 8 + (V3 - V2) / (-j2) = 0
Node 3: - (V3 - V2) / (-j2) - (V3 - 0) / j4 + (50∠30° - V3) / 6 + 10∠0° = 0

# Creating linear algebra problem

Let's rearrange these equations into a linear algebra problem.

For the supernode equation (Node 1 & 4 combined), we have:
(V2 / 8) + (V3 / j4) + (V3 / 6) - (50∠30° / 6) = 10∠0°

Expanding and combining terms gives us:

(1/8)V2 + (1/j4 + 1/6)V3 = 10∠0° + (50∠30° / 6)

For Node 2, we have:

-(V2 / 8) + (V3 - V2) / (-j2) = 0

Simplifying and combining like terms:

(-1/8 + 1/-j2)V2 + (1/-j2)V3 = 0

For Node 3, we have:

(V2 / -j2) - (V3 / -j2) - (V3 / j4) + (50∠30° / 6) = 10∠0° + (V3 / 6)

Rearranging the terms:

(V2 / -j2) + (-1/-j2 - 1/j4 - 1/6)V3 = 10∠0° - (50∠30° / 6)

This can then be combined into our final matrix
