The following is a list of properties of the circuit

# Component List
• 8Ω resistor
• -j2Ω capacitor
• j4Ω inductor

• 50∠30°V voltage source
• 10∠0°A current source

# Loops
There are 3 total loops.

Loop 1: left-most loop; consists of 8Ω resistor, -j2Ω capacitor, j4Ω inductor
Loop 2: bottom-right loop; consists of j4Ω inductor, 6Ω resistor, 50∠30°V voltage source
Loop 3: top loop; consists of 10∠0°A current source, 6Ω resistor

# Nodes
There are 4 total nodes
Node 1: bottom; connected to bottom of 8Ω resistor, bottom of j4Ω inductor, negative terminal of 50∠30°V voltage source
Node 2: middle-left; connected to top of 8Ω resistor, left of -j2Ω capacitor
Node 3: center; connected to right of -j2Ω capacitor, top of j4Ω inductor, left 6Ω resistor, outlet of 10∠0°A current source
Node 4: right-top; connected to inlet of 10∠0°A current source, right of 6Ω resistor, top of 50∠30°V voltage source

# Building the Matrix

I will use KVL analysis instead of the other option KCL. Note that the current in the kth loop will be set to Ik, so the loop current of Loop 1 is I1.

Loop 1: 8 * I1 + -j2 * I1 + j4 * (I1 - I2) = 0
Loop 2: j4 * (I2 - I1) + 6 * (I2 - 10∠0°) + 50∠30° = 0
Loop 3: Part of Supermesh, no equation

we can rearrange these equations to better convert to a linear algebra problem. I will not be simplifying or combining any phasor values.

(8 + j2) * I1 + (-j4) * I2 = 0
(  - j4) * I1 + ( 6 + j4) * I2 = 6 * 10∠0° - 50∠30°

These can be combined into final linear algebra problem. Note that the angle symbol(∠) is replaced with the latex equivalent(\angle) and the degree symbol(°) is replaced with latex equivalent(^\circ)

\begin{bmatrix}
8 + j2 & - j4 \\
  - j4 & 6 + j4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
I_1 \\
I_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
6 * 10\angle0^\circ - 50\angle30^\circ
\end{bmatrix}
